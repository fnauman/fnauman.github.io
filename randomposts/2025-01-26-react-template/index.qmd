<!-- ## Blog Post Content -->

As a seasoned Python developer, I'm used to the comfort of `conda` environments and the predictability of `pip`. But lately, I've been diving headfirst into the wild world of web development with React. What prompted this shift? The incredible advancements in AI tools like Claude's new [artifact](https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts) feature and ChatGPT's enhanced support for [rendering HTML and React](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1882876172339757392). These tools have made it ridiculously easy to generate React UIs with simple natural language prompts.

However, bridging the gap between AI-generated code and a functional, maintainable application required me to master a new set of tools and concepts. The most pressing challenge? Taming the JavaScript ecosystem. This blog post chronicles my journey, focusing on setting up a solid React template using Vite while navigating the intricacies of Node.js and its package managers.

### `create-react-app` does not work; `vite` does

My first instinct was to reach for the familiar [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/). Unfortunately, as of January 2025, there are significant issues (see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13911) and many others). 

Vite (French for "fast") is a next-generation build tool that significantly improves the front-end development experience. Here's how I set up my React template using Vite:

#### Prerequisites:

This guide assumes a Linux-based system (specifically Ubuntu 24.04 LTS in my case). I'll update my experiences with Windows later.

#### Step 1: Node.js and the Power of `nvm`

Before diving into Vite, we need Node.js, the runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript outside of a browser. However, different projects might require different Node.js versions. Here's where Node Version Manager (nvm) comes to the rescue.

-   **Installing `nvm`:**
    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
    ```
-   **Installing Node.js (LTS):**
    ```bash
    nvm install --lts
    ```

`nvm` allows you to seamlessly switch between Node.js versions using a simple `.nvmrc` file in your project root, ensuring compatibility across your projects.

#### Step 2: Initializing the React Template with Vite

With Node.js in place, creating a React template is a breeze:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app
```

This command prompts you to choose a framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) and whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript. I opted for React and JavaScript. You can also use the shorthand: `npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react`. 

#### Step 3: Understanding `npm` vs. `npx`

Throughout this process, you'll encounter both `npm` and `npx`. Here's a simple way to distinguish them:

-   **`npm` (Node Package Manager):** Use it to install packages, either globally or locally within a project.
-   **`npx` (Node Package Execute):** Use it to run packages, often one-off tools or generators, without installing them permanently.

For example, we used `npm create vite@latest` to initialize our project because `create-vite` is a tool we might use again. However, for tasks like adding a `shadcn` component later, we'll use `npx`.

#### Step 4: Environment isolation - `node_modules` Directory

Unlike Python's virtual environments, Node.js relies on a project-specific `node_modules` directory to store dependencies. This directory can become quite large, but it guarantees that each project has its own isolated set of packages.

**Key Takeaway:** Never share `node_modules` between projects. Always run `npm install` in a new project clone to populate the `node_modules` directory based on the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

#### Step 5: Embracing `tailwindcss` and `shadcn` (with a Caveat)

Modern React development often involves styling libraries like `tailwindcss` and component libraries like `shadcn`.

**Important Note:** `shadcn` is not an `npm` package but rather a collection of components that you can add to your project. It relies on Radix UI (`@radix-ui/react-*`) packages for its core functionality.

Integrating `tailwindcss` and `shadcn` can be tricky due to version conflicts. As of my writing, `tailwindcss` recently released a major version 4, and `shadcn`'s documentation hasn't fully caught up.

**My Solution:** I've created a [public template repository](https://github.com/fnauman/clip_react) that successfully integrates `tailwindcss` version `3.4.17` with `shadcn`. It includes all the necessary configuration changes to the Vite template.

#### Step 6: Organizing Your Code with Components

For larger projects, it's crucial to structure your code effectively. Instead of dumping everything into `src/App.tsx`, create a `src/components` directory for your UI components. You can then import these components into `App.tsx`. Most LLMs seem to bundle everything in a single `App.tsx` by default, but you can prompt them to write modular code by separating out the components.

Here's a suggested folder structure:

```
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Interface.tsx # Main UI code
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.tsx         # Import and use your UI components
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── main.tsx
│   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json / jsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.node.json
└── vite.config.ts / vite.config.js
```

#### Step 7: Running Your App

Finally, to see your app in action, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server, typically at `localhost:5173` (unlike `create-react-app`'s default `localhost:3000`).

### Conclusion: JavaScript Environment Isolation is Great

The JavaScript ecosystem can feel daunting at first, especially coming from a Python background. However, with tools like Vite and a clear understanding of Node.js's package management, setting up a modern React development environment becomes manageable.
