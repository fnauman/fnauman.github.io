Uploading datasets to [**huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/) turned out to be harder than I initially thought. 


## Data formatting

To be able to view the dataset in the Hugging Face Datasets Hub, the dataset needs to be formatted in the right way. I had an **image classification** dataset with several target attributes. I followed the guide [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/image_dataset). Here is how I formatted the dataset:

```bash
./
├── train
│   ├── metadata.csv
│   ├── front_2024_02_29_14_26_45.jpg
│   ├── ...
├── test
│   ├── metadata.csv
│   ├── front_2024_05_30_12_30_02.jpg
│   ├── ...

```

where the `metadata.csv` file contains the **file_name** as the first column and several other columns each corresponding to a target attribute. Here is a sample:

```bash
file_name,brand,usage,condition,type,category,price,trend,colors,cut,pattern,season,text,pilling,damage,stains,holes,smell,material
front_2022_12_14_08_48_42.jpg,Junkyard,Export,3,Jeans,Ladies,50-100,Denim,['Blue'],['Loose'],None,Spring,,4,,Minor,None,None,100%cotton
front_2023_06_29_08_22_48.jpg,Stacy,Reuse,4,Jeans,Unisex,50-100,None,['Brown'],['Tight'],None,All,,3,,None,None,None,"98% cotton, 2% elastane"
```

When rendered in the dataset viewer in the Hugging Face Datasets Hub, the dataset converts the **file_name** to an image preview with the title **image** and retains the other columns. Here is the preview of the dataset:

## What worked

In the same [`image_dataset` tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/image_dataset), they describe how to upload the dataset using the `python` command: 

::: {.callout-important}
`load_dataset` name is misleading: it is not *loading* the dataset, but it is really setting up your dataset *locally* in a format suitable for the data viewer in the Hugging Face Datasets Hub. It should really be called `setup_dataset`.
:::

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the LOCAL folder as a `huggingface/datasets` dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="./") # `imagefolder` is a special dataset type that loads images

# Upload the dataset to Hugging Face
dataset.push_to_hub("fnauman/fashion-second-hand-front-only", private=True) # `private=True` makes the dataset repo private
```

I recommend first uploading the dataset as a `private` dataset to ensure the upload worked and the data preview works as expected. You can later make the dataset public if you wish. 


## What did not work

Following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/upload), I tried using the `huggingface-cli` command with two variations, but it did not work. 

```bash
huggingface-cli upload fashion-second-hand-front-only . . --repo-type dataset
huggingface-cli upload-large-folder fashion-second-hand-front-only --repo-type dataset . --num-workers=8
```

Both of these commands crashed and were relatively slow. I suspect it has to do with the large number of files (30,000) in the dataset.
