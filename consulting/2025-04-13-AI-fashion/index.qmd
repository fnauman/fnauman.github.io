**OUTCOME**: 40% reduction in manual processing time with 50%+ decrease in data collection costs through innovative synthetic data techniques.
:::


## 1. Business Context
Manual quality inspection created major bottlenecks in circular fashion supply chains, with 30% inconsistency in assessments and excessive labor costs driving up prices by 25%. The industry needed automation to scale sustainable fashion initiatives.

## 2. Solution Snapshot (24 Months)
| Component | What We Built | Technologies |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Data Infrastructure** | Custom dual-camera capture system with specialized annotation platform | Flask APIs, Streamlit UI, RESTful backend |
| **Dataset Enhancement** | Quality control & balancing for 30,000+ images; metadata enrichment | Custom processing apps, Pytorch |
| **CV Model Architecture** | State-of-the-art attribute detection with 92% accuracy on primary categories | ConvNeXt, Vision Transformers (ViT) & CLIP variants |
| **Synthetic Data Pipeline** | Inpainting framework to generate realistic damage patterns for object detection | Prompt engineering, Automated mask generation |
| **Deployment System** | Web-based interface for real-time attribute detection | [Gradio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fashion-demo-organization/fashion_demo) |

## 3. Impact
* **40% reduction** in manual inspection processing time.
* **50%+ decrease** in data collection costs through synthetic data generation.
* **92% accuracy** on primary damage categories despite challenging long-tailed data.
* Created one of a kind public [dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/13788681) for fashion attribute detection research.
* Selected as 1 of only 5 projects presented at EU sustainable AI summit (2023).

## 4. My Role
* Led end-to-end project management for €1M AI initiatives across two major programs ([AI for Circular Fashion](https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/projects/ai-for-resource-efficient-circular-fashion), [CISUTAC](https://www.cisutac.eu/)).
* Designed technical architecture and coordinated cross-functional implementation.
* Personally implemented key components of synthetic data generation pipeline.
* Delivered presentations at Vinnova Innovation Week (2022) and [EU sustainable AI (2023)](https://swedish-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/events/event-on-sustainable-artificial-intelligence-ai-2-35/).
