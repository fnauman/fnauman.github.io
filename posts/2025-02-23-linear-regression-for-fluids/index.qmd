# Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics

Understanding and modeling real world fluid and plasma systems typically involves numerical simulations, low and high fidelity models, experimental data, and more recently data-driven methods. Below I will summarize some of the most popular data-driven methods used in fluid dynamics. 

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Highlights

- Linear regression (or variants thereof) is generally a good baseline for all sorts of data science problems, but for high dimension non-linear dynamical systems like fluids, it's often not enough.
- Bulk of the existing literature either analyze low-dimensional ODE systems like Lorenz-63 or data from 1-10 numerical simulations. 
- There is no single go-to algorithm, linear or otherwise, that works for multitude of fluid systems.

In this tutorial, we'll explore **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)**, **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)** and **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**, three powerful techniques for analyzing temporal snapshots from a fluid simulation. You'll learn how they work, how they differ, and how to apply them to your dataset, which consists of temporal snapshots `State(t, x, y)` for `t = 0, 1, ..., T`, where `x` and `y` are spatial coordinates ranging from `-Lx/2` to `+Lx/2` and `-Ly/2` to `+Ly/2`, respectively. We'll provide detailed steps for implementing all three algorithms and discuss their practical use in fluid dynamics.


## Understanding POD and DMD

### Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
POD is a method that decomposes a dataset into a set of orthogonal spatial modes that capture the most variance (or energy) in the data. In fluid dynamics, these modes often represent dominant flow structures. Mathematically, POD is equivalent to **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** or **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. It’s ideal for identifying the most significant spatial patterns without explicitly considering their temporal dynamics.

### Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
DMD, on the other hand, extracts spatial modes associated with specific temporal behaviors, such as frequencies and growth rates, by approximating the data as evolving under a linear dynamical system. It assumes that each snapshot can be related to the next via a linear operator, making it particularly useful for studying dynamic phenomena like oscillations or instabilities in fluid flows.

### Key Comparison
- **POD**: Provides energy-optimal modes (maximizing variance), but each mode may contain a mix of frequencies. It’s a static decomposition focused on spatial coherence.
- **DMD**: Provides dynamically relevant modes, each tied to a single frequency and growth rate, assuming a linear evolution. It’s suited for analyzing temporal dynamics.

## Preparing Your Data
Your fluid simulation data is given as `State(t, x, y)` for `t = 0` to `T`, with `x ∈ [-Lx/2, Lx/2]` and `y ∈ [-Ly/2, Ly/2]`. Assume the spatial domain is discretized into a grid of size `N_x × N_y`, where:
- `N_x` is the number of points along `x`,
- `N_y` is the number of points along `y`.

For each time `t`, `State(t, x, y)` is a 2D array of size `N_x × N_y`, representing a scalar field (e.g., pressure or a velocity component). If it’s vector-valued (e.g., velocity with components `u` and `v`), you can either:
1. Treat each component separately, or
2. Stack them into a longer vector.

Here, we’ll assume a scalar field for simplicity. Each snapshot `State(t, x, y)` is flattened into a vector `x_t` of length `N = N_x * N_y`. For example:
- `x_t = [State(t, x_1, y_1), State(t, x_2, y_1), ..., State(t, x_{N_x}, y_{N_y})]^T`.

You have `T+1` snapshots (from `t = 0` to `T`), so the data can be organized into a matrix for analysis.

## POD: Step-by-Step Algorithm

POD decomposes the full set of snapshots into spatial modes and temporal coefficients using SVD.

### Steps
1. **Form the Data Matrix**
   - Collect all snapshots into a matrix `X`:
     ```
     X = [x_0, x_1, ..., x_T]
     ```
     where each `x_t` is a column vector of length `N`. Thus, `X` is an `N × (T+1)` matrix.
   - In Python (using NumPy):
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     # Assume data is a 3D array of shape (T+1, N_x, N_y)
     X = data.reshape(T+1, N_x * N_y).T  # Shape: (N, T+1)
     ```

2. **Compute the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
   - Calculate the economy SVD of `X`:
     ```
     X = U Σ V^T
     ```
     - `U`: `N × (T+1)` matrix, columns are the POD modes (spatial patterns).
     - `Σ`: `(T+1) × (T+1)` diagonal matrix, diagonal elements `σ_k` are the singular values (indicating mode energy).
     - `V^T`: `(T+1) × (T+1)` matrix, rows are related to temporal coefficients.
   - Since `N >> T+1`, the rank of `X` is at most `T+1`, so the economy SVD is efficient.
   - In Python:
     ```python
     U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(X, full_matrices=False)
     # U: (N, T+1), S: (T+1,), VT: (T+1, T+1)
     ```

3. **Extract POD Modes**
   - The POD modes are the columns of `U`: `u_k = U[:, k-1]` for `k = 1, 2, ..., T+1`.
   - Each `u_k` is a vector of length `N`, which can be reshaped to `N_x × N_y` for visualization:
     ```python
     mode_k = U[:, k-1].reshape(N_x, N_y)
     ```

4. **Compute Temporal Coefficients**
   - The temporal evolution of mode `k` at time `t` is given by `σ_k * V[t, k-1]`, where:
     - `σ_k = S[k-1]` (singular value),
     - `V = VT.T`, so `V[:, k-1]` is the k-th column of `V`.
   - The snapshot at time `t` can be reconstructed as:
     ```
     x_t ≈ Σ_{k=1}^{T+1} u_k * σ_k * V[t, k-1]
     ```
   - In Python:
     ```python
     temporal_coeffs = VT.T * S  # Shape: (T+1, T+1)
     # For mode k at time t: S[k-1] * VT[k-1, t]
     ```

5. **Interpret Results**
   - **Modes**: Columns of `U` represent spatial structures, ordered by decreasing energy (`σ_k²`).
   - **Temporal Coefficients**: `σ_k * V[:, k-1]` show how each mode evolves over time.
   - Use these to identify dominant flow structures (e.g., large eddies) in your fluid simulation.

## DMD: Step-by-Step Algorithm

DMD approximates the dynamics by finding a linear operator that maps one snapshot to the next, then extracts modes with associated eigenvalues.

### Steps
1. **Form the Snapshot Matrices**
   - Split the data into two matrices:
     - `X = [x_0, x_1, ..., x_{T-1}]`: snapshots from `t = 0` to `T-1`, size `N × T`.
     - `Y = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_T]`: snapshots from `t = 1` to `T`, size `N × T`.
   - In Python:
     ```python
     X = data[:-1].reshape(T, N_x * N_y).T  # Shape: (N, T)
     Y = data[1:].reshape(T, N_x * N_y).T   # Shape: (N, T)
     ```

2. **Compute SVD of X**
   - Perform economy SVD on `X`:
     ```
     X = U Σ V^T
     ```
     - `U`: `N × r`, columns are basis vectors.
     - `Σ`: `r × r`, diagonal matrix of singular values.
     - `V^T`: `r × T`, right singular vectors.
     - `r ≤ T` is the rank, often truncated to reduce noise (e.g., keep singular values above a threshold).
   - In Python:
     ```python
     U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(X, full_matrices=False)
     # U: (N, r), S: (r,), VT: (r, T)
     # Optionally truncate r by selecting top k singular values
     r = min(T, np.sum(S > threshold))  # Define threshold based on data
     U = U[:, :r]
     S = S[:r]
     VT = VT[:r, :]
     ```

3. **Compute the Low-Dimensional Operator**
   - Approximate the linear operator `A` such that `Y ≈ A X`.
   - Project `A` onto the POD basis: `Ã = U^T A U ≈ U^T Y V Σ^{-1}`.
   - Compute:
     ```
     Ã = U^T Y V Σ^{-1}
     ```
     where `V = VT.T`, `Σ^{-1} = diag(1/S)`.
   - In Python:
     ```python
     V = VT.T  # Shape: (T, r)
     S_inv = np.diag(1.0 / S)  # Shape: (r, r)
     A_tilde = U.T @ Y @ V @ S_inv  # Shape: (r, r)
     ```

4. **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
   - Solve the eigenvalue problem for `Ã`:
     ```
     Ã w_k = λ_k w_k
     ```
     - `λ_k`: eigenvalues (complex), indicate growth rates and frequencies.
     - `w_k`: eigenvectors, size `r × 1`.
   - In Python:
     ```python
     lambda_k, W = np.linalg.eig(A_tilde)
     # lambda_k: (r,), W: (r, r)
     ```

5. **Compute DMD Modes**
   - The DMD modes are projections of the eigenvectors back to the full space:
     ```
     φ_k = U w_k
     ```
     - Each `φ_k` is a vector of length `N`.
   - In Python:
     ```python
     Phi = U @ W  # Shape: (N, r)
     # Mode k: Phi[:, k-1].reshape(N_x, N_y) for visualization
     ```

6. **Analyze Dynamics**
   - Each mode `φ_k` evolves as `λ_k^t` over time.
   - Interpret `λ_k`:
     - If `Δt` is the time step (here, `Δt = 1` since `t = 0, 1, ..., T`), then:
       ```
       λ_k = e^{(σ_k + i ω_k) Δt}
       ```
       - `σ_k = Re(log(λ_k))/Δt`: growth/decay rate.
       - `ω_k = Im(log(λ_k))/Δt`: frequency (radians per unit time).
   - Reconstruct the solution:
     - `x_t ≈ Σ_{k=1}^r φ_k λ_k^t b_k`, where `b_k` are amplitudes found by solving `x_0 = Φ b` (Φ = [φ_1, ..., φ_r]).
   - In Python:
     ```python
     # Compute b by projecting x_0 onto modes
     b = np.linalg.lstsq(Phi, X[:, 0], rcond=None)[0]
     # Dynamics for mode k: Phi[:, k-1] * (lambda_k ** t) * b[k-1]
     ```

7. **Interpret Results**
   - **Modes**: Columns of `Phi` are spatial patterns.
   - **Eigenvalues**: `λ_k` provide dynamic information (oscillation, stability).
   - Use these to identify periodic structures (e.g., vortex shedding) or instabilities.

## Applying POD and DMD to Your Fluid Simulation

### POD Application
- **Goal**: Identify dominant spatial structures.
- **Process**: Use all `T+1` snapshots in `X`. After computing SVD, visualize the first few POD modes (columns of `U`) to see the most energetic flow features. Analyze temporal coefficients to understand their evolution.
- **Example**: In a flow past a cylinder, POD might highlight the mean flow and large-scale vortices.

### DMD Application
- **Goal**: Extract dynamic modes with specific frequencies.
- **Process**: Use `X` and `Y` with `T` snapshots each. Compute DMD modes and eigenvalues. Plot modes and check `ω_k` for oscillatory behaviors (e.g., vortex shedding frequency).
- **Example**: DMD could isolate the vortex shedding mode with its exact frequency.

### Practical Tips
- **Visualization**: Reshape modes (`N` to `N_x × N_y`) and plot as 2D fields.
- **Truncation**: For noisy data, truncate SVD to `r < T` based on singular value decay.
- **Validation**: Compare reconstructed snapshots (`x_t`) with original data to assess accuracy.

## Conclusion
- **POD** is best for reducing dimensionality and capturing dominant structures, regardless of their temporal behavior.
- **DMD** excels at isolating dynamic modes, making it ideal for studying oscillations or predicting future states (if the linear assumption holds).

For your fluid simulation `State(t, x, y)`, apply POD to understand the overall flow structure and DMD to analyze its temporal dynamics. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of both spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow.
