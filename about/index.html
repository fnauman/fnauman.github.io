	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

I am a postdoc at Chalmers working in [CICO](http://cosmicorigins.space/cico) on problems related to massive star formation. 
Before this, I was a postdoc at Niels Bohr Institute. I finished my PhD from U. Rochester.

Currently, I am interested in using machine learning and non-linear optimization methods to gain insight into outstanding fluid and plasma questions.
