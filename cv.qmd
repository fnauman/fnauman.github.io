## Value Proposition

Principal consultant and interim team lead bridging strategy and hands-on delivery in production-scale data environments (telemetry/time series, vision, and LLM workflow automation). Selected outcomes from applied R&D / pilot deployments:
- 40% faster textile quality assessment workflow (pilot).
- 50%+ reduction in data collection/labeling effort via synthetic data (pilot).
- p to 90% lower edge hardware cost enabled by low-energy ML approach (prototype).

## Leadership Highlights

- Interim Team Lead for Data Science & Advanced Analytics (4-7 person) at a global industrial telemetry, roadmap ownership and stakeholder management.
- Led applied AI initiatives at RISE: [Vinnova](https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/projects/ai-for-resource-efficient-circular-fashion) (Project Lead, ~9M SEK) and [CISUTAC](https://www.cisutac.eu/) (AI Lead, ~2M SEK), delivering pilot-ready systems and public artifacts. 
- Scaled delivery practices: evaluation-first approach, privacy-aware workflows, requirements → success criteria → handover.
- Established and led an AI mentorship program for Master's thesis students, resulting in 4 industry-applicable projects.
