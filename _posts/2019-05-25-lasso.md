Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the standard approach to regression problems with its roots going back to [early 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares). OLS works well when the terms in the linear expansion are independent (no interactions), the errors/variance is nearly the same for each data point. Real data often contains outliers that ruin the fit. To circumvent this, one can regularize the coefficients such that the coefficients corresponding to largest deviations shrink to zero.
