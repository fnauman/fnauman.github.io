One popular class of ensemble machine learning algorithms is random forests that have been used extensively for tabular data. Random forests have the advantage that they require little hyperparameter fine tuning and are robust to outliers. There are two main sources of randomness in random forests: bootstrapping with replacement and the choice of only a random subset of features for each decision tree.

I have recently used random forests for modeling dynamos in helically forced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence [here](https://github.com/fnauman/ML_alpha2).
