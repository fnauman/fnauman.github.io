<!-- # About -->

I am Farrukh Nauman, PhD in Physics from University of Rochester, and currently working as an AI Researcher at [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB](https://www.ri.se/en). My research interests span a broad range from Applied AI domains like sustainable fashion to computational fluid dynamics applied to astrophysical flows.

<small>*Update (Dec. 18th, 2023)*: 

I am currently porting my old homepage (last updated in 2019) to this new one. Please bear with me while I do that. I might remove or update a couple of things in the process.</small>
