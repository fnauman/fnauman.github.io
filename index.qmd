I am Farrukh Nauman, PhD in Theoretial and Computational Astrophysics from the University of Rochester (2015). In my current job as an AI Researcher at [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB](https://www.ri.se/en), my work has involved large-scale [AI projects in the fashion industry](https://fnauman.github.io/second-hand-fashion/), LLMs for research reports, object detection applications in the farming industry, time series classification of sensor signals, etc. 

<br>

My broad research interests include my recent interest in LLM applications to computational fluid dynamics applied to astrophysical flows. I have several years of experience working with many programming languages and frameworks including Python, C, FORTRAN. One particular pashion that I have is for time series forecasting and I have worked on several projects in this domain both in academia and industry.

<small>*Update (Jun. 15th, 2024)*: 

I am currently porting my old homepage (last updated in 2019) to this new one. Please bear with me while I do that. I might remove or update a couple of things in the process.</small> -->
